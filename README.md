# HSSR (submitted to IJCAI'2021)

Our model HSSR is built on NeuRec (https://github.com/wubinzzu/NeuRec), which is a comprehensive and flexible Python library for recommender systems that includes a large range of state-of-the-art neural recommender models.

Hence, here, we only share the main code and the configuration file.
